# Hi, I'm Dennis Newman
*I am a student at California State University - Fullerton studying Computer Science.*

## About Me
I pursue an education in Computer Science out of passion for all things technological and nerdy.
I've grown up playing video games, and have fallen in love with computer-related studies and hobbies.
When I'm not studying, you can probably find me volunteering at church, playing Dungeons and Dragons with friends, or playing around developing applications on platforms such as Universal Windows.
